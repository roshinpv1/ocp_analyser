## Security & Quality Analysis

### Auditability

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Avoid Logging Confidential Data | ❌ Not Implemented | No logging of confidential data is implemented. | Avoid logging any confidential or sensitive information. |
| Create Audit Trail Logs | ❌ Not Implemented | No audit trail logging is implemented. | Implement audit trail logging for tracking actions and changes. |
| Tracking Id For Log Messages | ❌ Not Implemented | No tracking ID is used for log messages. | Implement a unique tracking ID for each request in log messages. |
| Log Rest Api Calls | ❌ Not Implemented | No logging of REST API calls is implemented. | Implement logging for all incoming and outgoing REST API requests. |
| Log Application Messages | ❌ Not Implemented | No logging of application messages is implemented. | Implement logging for application-level error and informational messages. |
| Client Ui Errors Are Logged | ❌ Not Implemented | No logging of client UI errors is implemented. | Implement logging for client-side error messages to help in debugging. |

### Availability

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Retry Logic | ❌ Not Implemented | No retry logic is implemented for HTTP requests. | Implement retry logic to handle transient errors. |
| Set Timeouts On Io Operations | ❌ Not Implemented | No timeout settings are seen for IO operations. | Set appropriate timeouts for IO operations to prevent uncontrolled delays. |
| Throttling Drop Request | ❌ Not Implemented | No request throttling is implemented. | Implement request throttling to limit the rate of incoming requests. |
| Circuit Breakers On Outgoing Requests | ❌ Not Implemented | No circuit breaker pattern is used for outgoing requests. | Implement circuit breakers to handle failures in dependent systems gracefully. |

### Error Handling

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Log System Errors | ❌ Not Implemented | No logging of system errors is implemented. | Implement logging for system-level errors to facilitate troubleshooting. |
| Use Http Standard Error Codes | ❌ Not Implemented | No use of HTTP standard error codes is seen. | Use appropriate standard HTTP error codes in responses. |
| Include Client Error Tracking | ❌ Not Implemented | No client error tracking is implemented. | Include unique tracking IDs in responses to enable client-side error tracking. |

### Monitoring

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Url Monitoring | ❌ Not Implemented | No URL monitoring is implemented. | Implement monitoring for critical URLs to ensure they are operational. |

### Testing

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Automated Regression Testing | ❌ Not Implemented | No automated regression testing is implemented. | Implement automated regression tests to ensure the application behaves as expected after changes. |
