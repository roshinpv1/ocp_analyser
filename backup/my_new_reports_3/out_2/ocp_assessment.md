# OpenShift Migration Assessment for Bill Pay

OpenShift Migration Assessment Report Summary The assessment for the component "Bill Pay" has been conducted. The application uses several components including Venafi, Redis, Channel Secure/PingFed, NAS/SMB, SMTP, AutoSys, MTLS/Mutual Auth, NDM, Legacy JKS File, SOAP Calls, REST API, APigee, Kafka, IBM MQ, MQ Cipher Suite, LDAP, Splunk, AppD, Elastic APM, Hamess/UCD for CI/CD, HardRock/MTLS auth, AppDynamics, RabbitMQ, Database, MongoDB, SQLServer, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Cassandra, Couchbase, Neo4j, Hadoop, Spark, Okta, SAML, Auth, JWT, OpenID, ADFS, SAN, MalwareScanner, and any other service. The assessment concluded that the component is not ready for migration to OpenShift. The reasons are detailed below: No matching components found in the codebase for Venafi, Redis, Channel Secure/PingFed, NAS/SMB, SMTP, AutoSys, MTLS/Mutual Auth, NDM, Legacy JKS File, SOAP Calls, REST API, APigee, Kafka, IBM MQ, MQ Cipher Suite, LDAP, Splunk, AppD, Elastic APM, Hamess/UCD for CI/CD, HardRock/MTLS auth, AppDynamics, RabbitMQ, Database, MongoDB, SQLServer, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Cassandra, Couchbase, Neo4j, Hadoop, Spark, Okta, SAML, Auth, JWT, OpenID, ADFS, SAN, MalwareScanner. The component uses unsupported or incompatible components that are not compatible with OpenShift, including any other service. Recommendations for addressing the migration challenges include: Migrate the component to a supported platform. Update the codebase to use only supported and compatible components. Contact the component vendor for support or alternative solutions. Document all changes made during migration and provide testing strategy recommendations to ensure successful migration.
