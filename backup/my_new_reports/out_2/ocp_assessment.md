The application uses multiple middleware components such as Redis, Channel Secure/PingFed, LDAP, and MongoDB among others. However, several critical fields are missing from the intake form, including details about the deployment environments, version branches, and test users. The migration feasibility score for Bill Pay is calculated to be 65 out of 100 due to the lack of comprehensive information on the application's dependencies, operational procedures, and monitoring mechanisms. The assessment identifies several technical blockers that need to be addressed before proceeding with the migration, including missing mandatory fields, version discrepancies, and deployment details. Based on these findings, the go/no-go recommendation for Bill Pay is No Go. Additional data must be collected to address the identified issues before a successful migration can be planned. Technical Dimensions Dimension Risk Score (0-100) Mandatory Field Completion 50/100 Data Consistency 70/100 Technical Feasibility 60/100 Resource Specification Validation 80/100 Migration Blockers and Concerns Blocker/Concern Severity Classification (High/Medium/Low) Description Missing Mandatory Fields High The intake form is missing critical fields such as Git repository link, active development and testing environments, and test users. Version Discrepancies Medium The version branches mentioned in the form are different from the current PROD version of the code running on PCF. This could lead to compatibility issues during migration. Deployment Details Low The application is not fully deployed on any environment in PCF, which makes it difficult to perform a thorough assessment. Required Architectural Changes Component Change Type Description Messaging Service (Kafka) Replace with OpenShift-compatible messaging service The application uses Kafka, but no OpenShift equivalent is mentioned. A suitable alternative should be identified and integrated. Databases (MongoDB, SQLServer) Migrate to OpenShift-compatible databases The application uses MongoDB and SQLServer, but no OpenShift equivalents are mentioned. A suitable alternative should be identified and integrated. Migration Strategy Since the Bill Pay application component is not fully deployed on PCF and there are several missing mandatory fields, a lift-and-shift strategy is recommended for this migration. The process involves migrating the existing components to OpenShift with minimal changes to the codebase. The migration plan should include the following steps: Collect additional data such as deployment environments, version branches, and test users from the application team. Migrate the existing components to OpenShift using a lift-and-shift strategy. Perform thorough testing of the migrated application on OpenShift to ensure compatibility and functionality. Implement any necessary architectural changes to the application based on the assessment findings.
