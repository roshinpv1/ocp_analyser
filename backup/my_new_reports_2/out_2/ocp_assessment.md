This indicates that not all components are compatible with OpenShift, which poses significant risks to the migration. Detailed Scoring Technical DimensionScore Component Declaration vs. Codebase Alignment40/100 (8 mismatches) Resource Specification Validation60/100 (No resource specifications provided for components not in the codebase) Technical Feasibility Checks50/100 (All components are declared, but their OpenShift compatibility needs further validation) Data Consistency and Validation Rules80/100 (Mandatory fields provided except for some not applicable to this application) Missing Critical Information Requests40/100 (Missing information related to specific components like RabbitMQ, database, and SQL server are requested but not provided) Migration Blockers or Concerns The primary migration blockers identified include: Mismatched components between the intake form and codebase: The application uses components like RabbitMQ, database, and SQL server, which are not declared in the intake form. Lack of resource specifications for non-declared components: This makes it difficult to ensure that the required resources are provisioned correctly on OpenShift. Required Architectural Changes To address these issues, the following architectural changes are recommended: Add explicit declarations for RabbitMQ, database, and SQL server in the intake form. Provide resource specifications for these components on OpenShift to ensure they are correctly provisioned. Migration Strategy The recommended migration strategy is a lift-and-shift approach. This involves migrating the existing components as-is while ensuring compatibility with OpenShift. The application will remain in its current environment until all necessary changes are made. Risk Assessment The likelihood and impact of risks associated with this migration are assessed as follows: Likelihood: Medium. The mismatched components and lack of resource specifications pose a moderate risk to the application's functionality and performance. Impact: High. The mismatched components can lead to compatibility issues, while the absence of resource specifications may cause resource contention or failure during deployment. Actionable Recommendations To mitigate these risks and ensure a successful migration, the following actions should be taken: Review and update the intake form to include all required components like RabbitMQ, database, and SQL server. Contact relevant stakeholders to obtain resource specifications for these components on OpenShift. Perform thorough testing of the application after migration to ensure compatibility and functionality. Potential Optimization Opportunities No specific optimization opportunities are identified in this assessment. The focus is on ensuring compatibility rather than optimizing resource usage.
