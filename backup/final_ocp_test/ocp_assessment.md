# OpenShift Migration Assessment for Banking API Gateway

OpenShift Migration Assessment Report Summary The assessment has determined that the Banking API Gateway application is not ready to be migrated to OpenShift. The primary reasons are: Missing Components: Several key components declared in the intake form are not present in the codebase. Non-OpenShift Compatibility: Some components like LDAP, SMTP, and legacy JKS files do not have OpenShift equivalents or require specific configuration changes to run on OpenShift. Migration Assessment The migration feasibility score for the Banking API Gateway application is 50/100. This score reflects the presence of missing components and non-OpenShift compatibility issues, which prevent a straightforward lift-and-shift migration. Scoring Breakdown Technical DimensionScores Component Declaration & Detection40/100 (Missing components) OpenShift Compatibility50/100 (Non-OpenShift compatibility issues) Total Score50/100 Migration Blockers Missing Components: LDAP, SMTP, legacy JKS files. Non-OpenShift Compatibility Issues: Configuration changes required for OpenShift compatibility, such as setting up mutual TLS and configuring SMTP in a containerized environment. Required Architectural Changes To address the migration blockers, the following architectural changes are recommended: LDAP Configuration: Integrate LDAP with OpenShift using OpenDS or other LDAP services. SMTP Configuration: Set up a dedicated SMTP server on OpenShift for email notifications and integrate it into the application code. JKS Files Configuration: Securely store JKS files in an external secure storage system like Keycloak or use Kubernetes Secrets. Risk Assessment The potential risks associated with the migration are: Configuration Changes: The application may require extensive changes to configuration files and code to work on OpenShift. Security Risks: Introducing new security measures like mutual TLS can introduce risks if not handled properly. Migration Strategy The recommended migration strategy for the Banking API Gateway application is a re-platform approach. This involves building a new microservices architecture on OpenShift that leverages its containerization and orchestration capabilities. Actionable Recommendations Configuration Changes: Update the application code to use OpenShift-compatible configurations for LDAP and SMTP. Data Migration: Develop a data migration plan to transfer existing database and cache data to the new OpenShift environment. Security Improvements: Implement security best practices, such as using Kubernetes Secrets for JKS files and configuring mutual TLS in the application code. Potential Optimization Opportunities For containerized workloads, the following optimization opportunities can be considered: Resource Right-sizing: Analyze resource utilization patterns to determine if existing resources are sufficient or if scaling is required. Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling: Decide whether to use horizontal scaling (scaling out) or vertical scaling (scaling up) based on the application's load characteristics.
