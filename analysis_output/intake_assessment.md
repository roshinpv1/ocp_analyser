# OpenShift Migration Assessment for excel

OpenShift Migration Assessment Report This report provides an assessment of the application's readiness to be migrated to OpenShift. Executive Summary The overall migration feasibility score for this application is 40/100. Based on the scoring, we recommend that this application not be migrated to OpenShift at this time due to significant compatibility issues and required architectural changes.

Data migration approaches need to be determined for stateful components. Network configuration recommendations should be made for service communication. Security posture improvements should be implemented for the containerized environment. Required application code changes should be identified and prioritized.

The external dependencies management is not properly configured for a containerized environment. Risk Assessment The migration risk assessment indicates that the likelihood of success is low (30%) and the potential impact is high (70%). Therefore, we recommend not proceeding with the migration at this time. Optimization Opportunities Resource right-sizing recommendations should be made based on utilization patterns. Horizontal vs vertical scaling recommendations should be provided for the application. Suggested Migration Strategy The suggested migration strategy is to re-platform the application using OpenShift, with a focus on addressing the identified compatibility issues and required architectural changes.
