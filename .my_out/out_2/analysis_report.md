| Avoid Logging Confidential Data | ‚úÖ Implemented | Confidential data is logged with masking or encryption | Continue practice |
| Create Audit Trail Logs | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented | Audit logs are written but not analyzed for completeness | Add detailed audit logging and analysis |
| Tracking Id For Log Messages | ‚úÖ Implemented | Correlation IDs are added to log messages | Ensure correlation IDs are consistently used |
| Log Rest Api Calls | ‚úÖ Implemented | API requests are logged with detailed information | Log all incoming and outgoing API calls |
| Log Application Messages | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented | Application messages are logged but not structured consistently | Standardize logging structure for consistency |
| Client Ui Errors Are Logged | ‚úÖ Implemented | Client-side errors are logged with severity levels | Implement detailed client error tracking |

### Availability

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Retry Logic | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented | Retry logic is implemented for network requests but not in all cases | Ensure retry logic applies to all API calls |
| Set Timeouts On Io Operations | ‚úÖ Implemented | Timeouts are set for I/O operations, but no specific values are documented | Define clear timeout thresholds and enforce them |
| Throttling Drop Request | ‚ùå Not Implemented | No throttling mechanism is in place | Add rate limiting to prevent abuse |
| Circuit Breakers On Outgoing Requests | ‚úÖ Implemented | Circuit breakers are used for critical API calls | Continue using circuit breakers |

### Error Handling

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Log System Errors | ‚úÖ Implemented | System errors are logged with detailed stack traces | Log all exceptions and errors with full details |
| Use Http Standard Error Codes | ‚úÖ Implemented | Standard HTTP error codes are used for response handling | Ensure consistent use of status codes |
| Include Client Error Tracking | ‚ùå Not Implemented | Client-side errors are not tracked with user context or severity levels | Implement detailed client error tracking |

### Monitoring

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Url Monitoring | ‚úÖ Implemented | Health check endpoints are available for monitoring | Ensure all critical endpoints are monitored |
| Metrics Collection | ‚ùå Not Implemented | No metrics are collected for performance monitoring | Integrate APM tools for comprehensive monitoring |
| Performance Monitoring | ‚úÖ Implemented | Performance metrics are collected and displayed in a dashboard | Use real-time insights for proactive maintenance |

### Testing

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Automated Regression Testing | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented | Regression tests are written but not regularly run | Implement automated testing and schedule regular runs |
| Unit Testing | ‚úÖ Implemented | Unit tests cover key components and logic | Ensure comprehensive coverage of all functionalities |
| Integration Testing | ‚ùå Not Implemented | No integration tests are present | Add integration tests to verify cross-component interactions |

### Security

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Input Validation | ‚úÖ Implemented | Input validation is performed for all API endpoints and forms | Ensure comprehensive input validation |
| Authentication | ‚úÖ Implemented | JWT-based authentication is used for user sessions | Implement stronger authentication mechanisms |
| Authorization | ‚ùå Not Implemented | No role-based access control is in place | Add role-based access controls |
| Encryption At Rest | ‚úÖ Implemented | Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 | Implement additional encryption layers for sensitive data |
| Encryption In Transit | ‚úÖ Implemented | HTTPS is used for all API calls and communications | Ensure all connections are encrypted |

### Performance

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Caching Strategy | ‚úÖ Implemented | Caching is implemented using Redis for frequently accessed data | Optimize caching strategies based on usage patterns |
| Connection Pooling | ‚úÖ Implemented | Connection pools are used to manage database connections efficiently | Optimize connection pool size and configurations |
| Async Processing | ‚úÖ Implemented | Asynchronous processing is used for long-running tasks like background jobs | Implement more efficient asynchronous patterns |

### Data Management

| Practice | Status | Evidence | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Data Validation | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented | Data validation is in place for input fields and database models | Add comprehensive data validation for all inputs |
| Database Indexing | ‚úÖ Implemented | Database indexes are optimized based on query performance | Regularly review and optimize database indexes |
| Backup Strategy | ‚ùå Not Implemented | No backup strategy is in place | Implement regular backups of the database |

## JIRA Stories

The following JIRA stories are relevant to this project:

### XYZ-101: Implement Jira integration for code analyzer

**Status**: In Progress

**Created**: 2023-05-15T10:30:00.000+0000

**Last Updated**: 2023-05-16T14:45:00.000+0000

**Description**:

As a user, I want to see my relevant Jira stories in the code analysis report so that I can track issues related to my codebase.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Fetch stories from Jira API
- Display summary, status, and description
- Show comments and attachments
- Integrate with existing report

**Comments**:

- **John Developer** (2023-05-15T15:22:00.000+0000):
  I've started working on this. Initial API connection is working.

- **Maria Manager** (2023-05-15T16:05:00.000+0000):
  Great! Make sure to handle authentication errors gracefully.
