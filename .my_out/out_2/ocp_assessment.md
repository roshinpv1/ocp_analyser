# OpenShift Migration Assessment for Bill Pay

OpenShift Migration Assessment Report Summary The assessment has been performed for the component "Bill Pay". The application is not currently running in PCF. It uses various services such as Redis, SMTP, and other unspecified services. There are no test users available for testing during migration. Technical Dimensions Dimension Score Comments Compatibility with OpenShift 50/100 The application uses various services that are not natively supported by OpenShift, and the codebase does not contain components that can be easily migrated to containerized environments. Resource Management 50/100 The application uses various services that require specific configuration settings for OpenShift compatibility, and the resource usage patterns need to be carefully evaluated before migration. Maintenance and Monitoring 75/100 The application has existing monitoring and logging mechanisms that can be integrated with OpenShift, but the compatibility with specific services needs to be evaluated. Migration Feasibility Based on the analysis, it is not feasible to migrate the component "Bill Pay" to OpenShift. The application uses various services that are not natively supported by OpenShift and do not have equivalents in containerized environments. Migration Strategy The recommended strategy for migrating this component is a lift-and-shift approach, where the existing infrastructure is replicated on OpenShift. This will allow the application to run with minimal changes and minimize downtime during the migration process. Risk Assessment Category Likelihood Impact Technical Challenges High The application uses various services that are not natively supported by OpenShift and do not have equivalents in containerized environments. Resource Constraints Medium The resource usage patterns need to be carefully evaluated before migration, which may require additional resources and effort. Operational Changes Low The application has existing monitoring and logging mechanisms that can be integrated with OpenShift, so there will be minimal changes to the operational procedures. Recommendations To successfully migrate this component to OpenShift, the following actions are recommended: Replicate the existing infrastructure on OpenShift using a lift-and-shift approach. Review and update the deployment and operational procedures for compatibility with OpenShift. Identify any critical components that need to be migrated to containerized environments, and evaluate the feasibility of doing so.
